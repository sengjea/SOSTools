Run the script setup-pkg.sh first.

Launch PackageMaker.

If PackageMaker displays the "Install Properties" dialog box, fill it:

  Organization: ofilabs.com
  Minimum Target: Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard

Go to the Configuration tab and fill it:

  Title: EightPack Alpha1
  User Sees: Easy Install Only
  Destination: check only "User home directory"

Click "Edit Interface" button and customize the step-by-step wizard
as necessary.

Open PackageRoot subdirectory (from this directory) in Finder. Drag and
drop it into the Contents panel of PackageMaker.

Choose the PackageRoot/ entry, go to Contents tab. Expand the tree view of
the listed file.

Select All, and then (bottom right) change Owner to root and Group to wheel.

Go to Configuration tab and fill it:

    Package Identifier: EightPack.Alpha1.pkg
    Package Version: Alpha1
    Restart Action: None
    uncheck "Require admin authentication"

Go to Scripts tab, choose PackageRoot/eightpack/scripts/update-path.sh as the
Postinstall.

The project is ready. "Build and Run" will prepare the package and run it.

Note: there will be "Require Admin Authorization" warning, this can be ignored
since intentionally no admin authorization is needed (the target install
directory is the user's home directory).
